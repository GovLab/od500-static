The first Open Data Roundtable was held in Washington, DC on June 18, 2014. It was
co-hosted by the GovLab and the White House Office of Science and Technology
Policy (OSTP) together with the U.S. Department of Commerce. Under Secretary of
Commerce for Economic Affairs Mark Doms led the Department's planning and
engagement with the event, and participated for the entire day. Over 20 other
officials and staff from the Department of Commerce participated as well, with
appearances by Secretary Penny Pritzker and Acting Deputy Secretary Bruce
Andrews. Nick Sinai, U.S. Deputy Chief Technology Officer, and Erie Meyer,
Senior Advisor to the U.S. CTO, represented OSTP at the event. The GovLab is
now compiling a report on the Roundtable for public release.
