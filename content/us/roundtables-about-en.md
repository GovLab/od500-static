The GovLab is hosting a series of Roundtables that will bring together federal
agencies with the businesses and other organizations that use their data,
drawing on the work of the Open Data 500. The U.S. Open Data Action Plan,
released by the White House on May 9, 2014, describes these Roundtables as
a key part of meeting the commitment to “support innovators and improve open
data based on feedback.” The Plan notes that “Specific, actionable feedback
from these sessions [the Roundtables] and others has the potential to improve
descriptions, formats, and accessibility of government data.”
