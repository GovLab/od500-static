The Open Data 500 is the first comprehensive study of U.S. companies that use
open government data to generate new business and develop new products and
services. Open Data is free, public data that can be used to launch commercial
and nonprofit ventures, do research, make data-driven decisions, and solve
complex problems.

## The Govlab’s Approach

The Open Data 500 study is conducted by the GovLab at New York University with
funding from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. The GovLab works to
improve people’s lives by changing how we govern, using technology-enabled
solutions and a collaborative, networked approach. As part of its mission, the
GovLab studies how institutions can publish the data they collect as open data
so that businesses, organizations, and citizens can analyze and use this
information.

## What The Study Is Not

The Open Data 500 is not a rating or ranking of companies. It covers companies
of different sizes and categories, using various kinds of data.

The Open Data 500 is not a competition, but an attempt to give a broad,
inclusive view of the field.

The Open Data 500 study also does not provide a random sample for definitive
statistical analysis. Since this is the first thorough scan of companies in the
field, it is not yet possible to determine the exact landscape of open data
companies.
