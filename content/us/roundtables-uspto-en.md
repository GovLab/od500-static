### December 8, 2014

<p class="drop-cap">On December 8, 2014, The GovLab and the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) co-hosted an Open Data Roundtable in Washington, DC.
The impetus for this event was the first Open Data Roundtable, held with the
U.S.  Department of Commerce where USPTO identified a need to further engage
its data users in devising its open data roadmap for the next few years. At the
USPTO Roundtable, Alan Marco, USPTO’s Chief Economist, and Lynn Overmann,
Deputy Chief Data Officer of the Department of Commerce (DOC), both emphasized
the agency’s desire to more actively engage data users and technologists by
involving the developer community and creating ongoing feedback loops and
collaborations. This Roundtable was primarily focused on USPTO’s patent data,
which is much more challenging than trademark data: while owners wish to
promote their trademarks, and thereby provide good data to USPTO, there are
many more data collection, format, and quality issues associated with patent
data.</p>
