# About This Project

As part of its <a href="http://datos.gob.mx/">Open Data policy</a>, the Federal
Government of Mexico is working in partnership with The GovLab at New York
University to conduct the Open Data 100 Mexico. This is the first study of
Mexican companies and NGO's that use open government data to generate new
business, develop new products and services, and create social value.
