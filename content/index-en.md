The OD500 Global Network is an international network of organizations that seek
to study the use and impact of open data. Coordinated by the [Governance Lab
(GovLab)](http://thegovlab.org/) the OD500 Global Network enables participating
organizations to analyze open data in their country in a manner that is both
globally comparative and domestically specific. The OD500 Global Network starts
from the assumption that only by mapping the use of open data within and across
countries, can new approaches for understanding the economic and social impact
of open government data be generated.
