# GovLab Digest

The Governance Lab (The GovLab) at New York University strives to improve
people’s lives by changing how we govern. Founded in 2012, with funding from
the MacArthur and Knight Foundations, the GovLab designs technology, policy and
strategies for fostering more open and collaborative approaches to governance,
and tests what works.

innovation to tackle public problems. A partnership between The GovLab and MIT
Media Lab’s Online Learning Initiative, the site offers videos, podcasts,
readings and activities designed to enable the purpose-driven learner to deepen
his or her practical knowledge.
