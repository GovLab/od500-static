<p class="drop-cap">The GovLab is hosting a series of Roundtables that will
bring together federal agencies with the businesses and other organizations
that use their data, drawing on the work of the Open Data 500. [The U.S. Open
Data Action Plan, released by the White House on May 9, 2014][1], describes
these Roundtables as a key part of meeting the commitment to “support
innovators and improve open data based on feedback.” The Plan notes that
“Specific, actionable feedback from these sessions [the Roundtables] and others
has the potential to improve descriptions, formats, and accessibility of
government data.”</p>

## Objectives

<img src="/theme/img/roundtables/roundatables-series-dots-2.jpg" class="in-content-image">

The Open Data Roundtables bring together data providers in government and data users in business and the nonprofit sector to identify the kinds of datasets that have the greatest value, and to determine what is needed to make them as useful as possible. The Roundtables are designed to:

  * __Prioritize__ the most important datasets in each agency for business and
    public use.
  * __Improve__ each agency’s data and make it easier to find, access, and work
    with.
  * __Connect__ businesses and organizations with government agency staff who
    manage the data they use, and set up a process for ongoing feedback.

The GovLab will publish summaries of the Roundtables and their results for
a public audience.

The Open Data Roundtable Series is designed to establish a new way of planning,
preparing, and implementing the release of open data at the federal level. The
shift to demand-driven open data will help agencies prioritize their work on
open data much more effectively, meet the needs of users more efficiently, and
potentially release billions of dollars in economic value through new, targeted
data release.

> Specific, actionable feedback from these sessions [the Roundtables] and
> others has the potential to improve descriptions, formats, and accessibility
> of government data.
