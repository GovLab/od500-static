<h1>OD500 Global Network</h1>

<p>The OD500 Global Network is an
international network of organizations that seek to study the use
and impact of open data. Coordinated by the <a
href="http://thegovlab.org/">Governance Lab
(GovLab)</a> the OD500 Global Network enables participating organizations to
analyze open data in their country in a manner that is both
globally comparative and domestically specific. The OD500 Global Network
starts from the assumption that only by mapping the use of open
data within and across countries, can new approaches for
understanding the economic and social impact of open government
data be generated.</p>
