This, in turn, allows IAG to provide premiums that accurately and fairly represent a customer’s risk.  As part of this – IAG uses a significant amount of natural hazard flood data from many sources at the local and state government levels.\r\n\r\nIAG uses natural hazard and weather information to get a clearer understanding of the impact of a major event, such as a cyclone, bushfire or flood, before, during and after they strike.  This allows IAG to scale their major event response rapidly to help affected customers recover from the event quickly, as well as notify our business partners, such as reinsurers, and the share market of the impact.\r\n\r\nIAG also has specialised teams with advanced analytics capabilities who use census demographics to deliver market leading insights to enhance and constantly improve the customer experience.\r\n", "dataWishlist" : "National, consistent natural hazards datasets:  Whilst IAG currently uses some natural hazards open data – its typically delivered in disparate datasets, is of varying quality and doesn’t always adhere to a standard.  Having national, consistent datasets would allow governments, business and the community to use the data more readily and to better understand the risks.\r\n\r\nEmergency response datasets: Access to emergency response data, real-time and post-event, would allow IAG to gain a more immediate and clearer view of an event’s impact.  This would allow IAG to help its affected customers faster and provide more certainty to our business partners (e.g. reinsurers) and shareholders.\r\n\r\nBuilding attributes: To understand the risk of natural perils and non-natural perils (e.g. burglary) at a more granular level, as well as provide customers a better experience through a simpler quoting process and to avoid underinsurance:  a better understanding of the assets IAG insures is needed.\r\nExamples of building attribute data required includes:  construction type, number of bedrooms & high-resolution elevation data. GA’s NEXIS dataset, currently unavailable to non-government users due to licensing, is a good example of this.\r\n\r\nMotor Vehicle data: Access to de-identified motor vehicle registration data and accident data would be beneficial to reducing risk in the community.  Registration data would allow IAG to better identify individual motor vehicles and simplify the quoting process. Granular Accident data would allow IAG’s advanced analytics teams to identify blackspots to drive a public education program to inform drivers of the potential risk for accidents in their local area.\r\n", "sourceCount" : "101+", "notes" : "Email sent 25/3", "dataComments" : "The open government data that is available is useful and an important input into IAG’s understanding of risk and customer needs, as well as how IAG responds to customers during major disasters.\n\nHowever whilst data is generally available in a usable form, in some circumstances the datasets are incomplete (e.g. flood data), or a web service is unavailable or performs poorly (e.g. some Geoscience Australia services).  It would be beneficial to see these issues resolved.\n\nA lack of completeness of metadata for all open (and closed) datasets created by Government or with government funding also creates issues. Finding and understanding what data is available at all levels of government is complex and time-consuming. Duplication and inefficiency in many datasets created by all levels of government is commonplace. It would be ideal to have more coordination, transparency and governance by the various governments to identify owners, creators and the locations of all open datasets and the research that creates them.  http://data.gov.au facilitates this to some degree, but missing datasets & metadata limits its usefulness.\n\nRegarding geospatial web services – it would be good if more spatial data was available as standards based vector web services such as GeoJSON or WFS – this would allow for example dynamic analysis of the weather as well as visualisation.  Most spatial web services are currently WMS based, which only allows for visualisation.\n" },{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5510d67ecfbb100003c19270" }, "companyName" : "Minter Ellison Lawyers", "state" :
